## Case of Competiting Sovereigns
## Two Sides in this case:
## Defendant's Argument
1. The Australian Courts did not have jurisdiction, rather the United States had jurisdiction because that is where the Washington Post is based.
2. It is unreasonable for American publications to be subjected to every possible jurisdiction just because it is accessible on the Internet.
3. The Country in which the Server is located has Jurisdiction
## Plaintiff's Argument
1. The injury occurred in the State of Victoria in Australia, so they do have jurisdiction
2. The United States wants to enforce its laws throughout the world
